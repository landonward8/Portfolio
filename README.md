# Airport-Database
https://github.com/landonward8/Airport-Database
Database that I developed with a partner for CMPT307 to help Aiports keep track of valuable information like Destination, Flight Time, Seat Capacity of a plane, etc. I chose to have this assignment in my portfolio because it demonstrates my ability to work with a partner and collabrate. When we built the database, Southwest Airlines was having major issues with their system and flights were getting cancelled. Our idea was to fix this and build a database! We used Python and SQL to do so. 

# Massey Ratings
https://github.com/landonward8/MasseyRatings
Developed a ranking system for NBA teams using Massey's method, which was previously employed in the BCS ranking system, using Python. Implemented algorithms to analyze team performance data, including wins, losses, and opponent strength, to calculate rankings. I chose this assignment because it showcases my critial thinking skills by Using Linear Algebra and Python to build the rankings. This program also requried creativty because it is an algorithim that could be applied to any Sports League!
