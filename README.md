# Capstone Project 
https://github.com/landonward8/fitnessLog/tree/main
For my capstone project, I developed a comprehensive fitness application tailored to enhance individual health and wellness. Utilizing Swift and developed in Xcode, this sophisticated app offers unique features designed to monitor and promote various aspects of a user's health. Key functionalities include:

Water Tracking: Helps users stay hydrated by tracking their daily water intake. Calorie Tracking: Logs daily caloric consumption. Sleep Tracking: Monitors sleep pattern. Mood Tracking: Allows users to record their mood. Journal Feature: Enables users to keep a personal journal, encouraging them to document their fitness journey and reflect on their daily experiences and progress. Weight Tracking: Enables the user to track their weight.

# Airport-Database
https://github.com/landonward8/Airport-Database
Database that I developed with a partner for CMPT307 to help Aiports keep track of valuable information like Destination, Flight Time, Seat Capacity of a plane, etc. I chose to have this assignment in my portfolio because it demonstrates my ability to work with a partner and collabrate. When we built the database, Southwest Airlines was having major issues with their system and flights were getting cancelled. Our idea was to fix this and build a database! We used Python and SQL to do so. 

# Massey Ratings
https://github.com/landonward8/MasseyRatings
Developed a ranking system for NBA teams using Massey's method, which was previously employed in the BCS ranking system, using Python. Implemented algorithms to analyze team performance data, including wins, losses, and opponent strength, to calculate rankings. I chose this assignment because it showcases my critial thinking skills by Using Linear Algebra and Python to build the rankings. This program also requried creativty because it is an algorithim that could be applied to any Sports League!

# BitmapTransformations
https://github.com/landonward8/BitmapTransformations/blob/main/project2.c
This Image Transformation Program is a C-based program that enhances my understanding of system-level operations through the manipulation of .bmp image files using file mapping and memory management. By directly mapping these files into memory, this uses efficient data access and manipulation, offering insights into the operating system's handling of file I/O operations. This approach not only improves performance but also provides practical experience with memory management techniques, including memory allocation and optimization in a real-world application context.  In this project I practiced low-level programming, system calls, and the handling of virtual memory, making it a valuable tool for grasping the intricacies of computer systems.

# Fruit Rush
https://landonward8.itch.io/fruit-rush-avengers 
Fruit rush is an engaging educational game designed for first and second graders, focusing on foundational mathematics through interactive math qeustions. Developed to enhance both individual learning and classroom integration, the game features a teacher dashboard for tracking progress and tailoring instruction. Fruit rush supports the global responsibility learning goal, by teaching kids that math can be fun through vibrant and engaging gameplay. The game encourages children to apply their math skills in various scenarios, reinforcing the idea that math is not only a subject to be studied in school but also something fun that they can do. This approach not only boosts mathematical fluency but also nurtures a sense of joy in the kids, making Fruit Rush an invaluable educational resource that supports both academic development and keeping the children engaged.

# Chat Room
https://github.com/landonward8/ChatRoom/tree/main
Developed a Java-based chat application that enables real-time communication between users connected over a network. This application integrates multiple aspects of Java networking, featuring components such as a server that handles incoming connections, and client-side utilities for messaging and user interface interactions. This project honed my skills in implementing a complex network communication system. The program's design demonstrates my ability to apply critical software engineering principles and my proficiency in using Java to solve real-world problems.
