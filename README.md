# Capstone Project 
https://github.com/landonward8/fitnessLog/tree/main
For my capstone project, I developed a comprehensive fitness application tailored to enhance individual health and wellness. Utilizing Swift and developed in Xcode, this sophisticated app offers unique features designed to monitor and promote various aspects of a user's health. Key functionalities include:

Water Tracking: Helps users stay hydrated by tracking their daily water intake. Calorie Tracking: Assists in dietary management by logging daily caloric consumption. Sleep Tracking: Monitors sleep patterns to ensure a restful night's sleep, contributing to overall well-being. Mood Tracking: Offers a reflective look at emotional health by allowing users to record and analyze their mood over time. Journal Feature: Enables users to keep a personal journal, encouraging them to document their fitness journey and reflect on their daily experiences and progress.

# Airport-Database
https://github.com/landonward8/Airport-Database
Database that I developed with a partner for CMPT307 to help Aiports keep track of valuable information like Destination, Flight Time, Seat Capacity of a plane, etc. I chose to have this assignment in my portfolio because it demonstrates my ability to work with a partner and collabrate. When we built the database, Southwest Airlines was having major issues with their system and flights were getting cancelled. Our idea was to fix this and build a database! We used Python and SQL to do so. 

# Massey Ratings
https://github.com/landonward8/MasseyRatings
Developed a ranking system for NBA teams using Massey's method, which was previously employed in the BCS ranking system, using Python. Implemented algorithms to analyze team performance data, including wins, losses, and opponent strength, to calculate rankings. I chose this assignment because it showcases my critial thinking skills by Using Linear Algebra and Python to build the rankings. This program also requried creativty because it is an algorithim that could be applied to any Sports League!

# BitmapTransformations
https://github.com/landonward8/BitmapTransformations/blob/main/project2.c
This Image Transformation Program is a C-based program that enhances my understanding of system-level operations through the manipulation of .bmp image files using file mapping and memory management. By directly mapping these files into memory, the uses efficient data access and manipulation, offering insights into the operating system's handling of file I/O operations. This approach not only improves performance but also provides practical experience with memory management techniques, including memory allocation and optimization in a real-world application context.  In this project I practiced low-level programming, system calls, and the handling of virtual memory, making it a valuable tool for grasping the intricacies of computer systems.
